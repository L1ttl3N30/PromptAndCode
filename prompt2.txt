You are my senior full-stack engineer. Generate a complete, production-ready codebase for a web application with the features and delivery requirements listed below. Do not summarize. Do not leave TODOs. Provide full working code, file-by-file.

SCOPE (MVP):
- MCQ test system (create tests/questions in admin, student test-taking UI, timer, auto-scoring, results page).
- Literature long-answer test with AI grading (students submit; API grades via OpenAI using keyword+rubric matching; store score+feedback).
- Payment system using Stripe: support one-time per-test purchases AND subscription (weekly or monthly). Successful payment unlocks access to purchased tests. Implement webhook handling to confirm purchases and update access.
- User authentication: email + password sign-up/login/logout. Dashboard showing available tests and access control based on purchases.
- Admin UI for creating tests/questions and viewing results.

OUT OF SCOPE (for now): cheating detection, Zoom classes, advanced analytics, mobile app, advanced test modes.

TECH STACK (use these exactly):
- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL
- NextAuth (email/password) with session cookies
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Stripe for payments (checkout + webhooks)
- OpenAI API for grading
- Dockerfiles and docker-compose for local/postgres+app dev
- Seed script to create admin user and sample tests

DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Full folder structure with every file included.
2. Print every file's code in separate, copy-paste ready sections (no placeholders).
3. Database: Prisma schema, migration + seed script that creates an admin user and sample tests.
4. Authentication: full signup/login/logout, middleware protecting routes/pages.
5. Stripe: checkout sessions, webhook handler, models to track payments & access, subscription + one-time logic.
6. MCQ engine: admin create UI, student test UI, timer, scoring, store results, results page.
7. AI grading: API endpoint that sends answers to OpenAI, performs keyword/rubric matching (configurable weights), stores score+feedback, and shows result page.
8. Frontend: Tailwind UI components, admin pages, student dashboard.
9. .env.example with all variables (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, STRIPE_SECRET, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, OPENAI_KEY, etc.).
10. Deployment instructions for both Vercel (recommended) and Docker (alternative).
11. Provide scripts for migrations, seed, and start dev server.
12. Ensure no missing imports, consistent types, and working logic.
13. Include a README with exact setup steps and how to test webhooks locally (ngrok example).

ASSUMPTIONS & SMALL RULES:
- Use PostgreSQL as the DB.
- Use SendGrid for emails; if a key is not provided, stub out sending with a console log but keep the integration code.
- Admin account is created by seed script (email: admin@example.com, password: AdminPass123).
- For OpenAI grading, implement a default rubric: 40% keywords, 30% structure/coherence, 30% style/grammar — make weights configurable.
- Provide sample `.env.example`.
- No TODOs or placeholders. Use env variables for secrets.

If you accept these constraints, generate the full project. If you need to change a default (e.g., a different email provider), pick a sensible alternative and state it at the top of your output.

IMPORTANT:
Due to token limits, deliver the code FILE-BY-FILE across multiple responses.
After finishing each response, stop naturally when the limits are reached.
I will reply with "Continue" to get the remaining files.
Do NOT skip any part of the code.
