You are an expert educator and curriculum designer and cyber security expert. I want you to generate a complete printable book based on my personal learning roadmap.

🎯 GOAL:
Create a structured, well-written educational book that I can print and study on paper. It should guide me step-by-step through my roadmap with clear definitions, explanations, examples, exercises, and revision checkpoints.

📌 MY ROADMAP:
[INSERT YOUR FULL ROADMAP HERE — list topics in order, milestones, goals, subtopics, timeline if any]

🧠 BOOK REQUIREMENTS:
1. Structure & Layout
   - Title page
   - Table of contents
   - Chapters for each major topic in my roadmap
   - Each chapter must include:
     - Clear explanation section
     - Key concepts & principles
     - codes for simple “In Practice” real-world applications 
     - “Self-Check” quiz or mini-test
     - “Common Mistakes” section
     - End-of-chapter summary + checklist
   - Final revision chapter

2. Writing Style
   - Clear, engaging, and concise
   - Use simple language unless technical detail is required
   - Teach progressively, from basics to advanced
   - Avoid unnecessary jargon
   - Use numbered lists, tables, diagrams (text-based), and bullet points

3. Formatting for Print
   - Use headings and subheadings hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
   - Keep chapters separated
   - Use “--- Page Break ---” markers where natural breaks occur
   - Do NOT use placeholder text
   - Fully write out all sections
   - No summaries of content—write the full content

4. Exercises & Assessments
   - Include practice questions, MCQs, written prompts, and short case studies
   - Provide model answers after each quiz (in separate section)

5. Output Style
   - Deliver as text in response, correctly structured
   - Ensure everything is complete — no TODOs
   - I will say “Continue” if the response is cut off due to length
   - Continue chapter by chapter until the full book is complete

📢 Start by:
1. Confirming you understand the scope
2. Suggest an optimal book title
3. Draft a full table of contents based on my roadmap
4. Ask me to confirm or adjust
5. Once approved, begin writing the book content, starting with Title Page and Introduction

Do NOT start writing chapters until I confirm the table of contents.

If you understand, respond with:
“Ready to create your book. Please provide or confirm the roadmap.”
