PROMPT START

You are my senior full-stack engineer. I want you to generate a complete, production-ready codebase for a web application with these features:

MVP FEATURES (SCOPE):

MCQ test system

Admin can create tests and questions

Students can take tests

Timer

Auto-scoring

Results page

Literature long-answer test with AI grading

Students submit long answers

AI evaluates based on keyword matching + rubric

Score + feedback stored in database

Payment system

Students can pay per test, weekly, or monthly

Use Stripe

Unlocks access after successful payment

Webhook handling

User authentication

Email + password

Login, logout, signup

Dashboard showing available tests

Access control based on purchases

OUT OF SCOPE FOR NOW:

Cheating detection

Zoom classes

Advanced admin analytics

Teacher dashboards

Mobile app

Randomization or advanced test modes

TECH STACK

Use the following stack for the entire project:

[PUT YOUR CHOSEN STACK HERE — example below]

Example (if you want me to choose the best option for you):
→ Use Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Stripe + NextAuth + TailwindCSS
→ Use OpenAI API for AI grading

(You can replace this with Laravel, Django, or anything else you want.)

DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS

Generate a complete, runnable project with:

1. Full folder structure

All directories and files

Exactly how to organize the backend, frontend, and database

2. All code, file-by-file

Every file in the project

No placeholders

Real working logic

Real schemas, routes, API handlers, pages, components

3. Database

Full schema

Migration files

Prisma schema (if applicable)

Seed scripts

4. Authentication

Fully implemented

Working signup, login, logout

Session storage

Middleware protecting pages

5. Payment System (Stripe)

Checkout sessions

Webhooks

Subscription OR one-time purchase logic

Unlocking access to tests

Models to track payments & access

6. MCQ Test Engine

Admin test creation UI

Test-taking UI

Timer

Scoring logic

Results storage

Results page

7. Literature AI Grading

API endpoint that sends student answer → OpenAI

Keyword/rubric matching logic

Stores score + feedback

Page to view AI-graded result

8. Frontend UI

Ready-to-use Tailwind CSS components

Simple, clean dashboard

Admin pages

Student pages

9. Environment Variables

Provide a .env.example with all needed keys:

Database URL

Stripe keys

OpenAI key

NextAuth keys

Server secrets

10. Deployment Instructions

Provide instructions for deployment on:

Vercel (frontend + backend)
OR

Docker + server deployment
(Choose whichever is best for the chosen stack)

11. After generating all code

Do the following:

Provide a ZIP-style project structure overview

Print every file's code in separate expandable sections

Give me step-by-step setup instructions

Provide scripts to run migrations, seed, and start the dev server

Verify the entire codebase is internally consistent with no missing imports

IMPORTANT RULES

Do NOT summarize.

Do NOT leave “TODO” comments.

Provide full working code.

If something requires secrets (Stripe, OpenAI), reference an env variable.

If the app needs models, create them fully.

If an API endpoint is required, implement it fully.

If configuration is needed (like NextAuth or Prisma), include it in full.

Assume you are delivering a production-ready, complete starting codebase.
